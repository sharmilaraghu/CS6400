review
Once again Mr Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters Most of us have ghosts in the closet and Costners character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time I did not care The character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident Ashton Kutcher The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker Costner tells us all about Kutchers ghosts We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing No magic here it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in
This is a pale imitation of Officer and a Gentleman There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest The dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed Its too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!) I love the USCG its men and women are fearless and tough The action scenes are awesome but this movie doesnt do much for recruiting I fear The script is formulaic but confusing Kutchers character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasnt his fault? Costners is raging against the dying of the light but why? His conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my moneys worth
